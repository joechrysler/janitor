Hi there!

#janitor
is a simple zimlet written for Zimbra Collaboration Suite 6
that gives users a heads up a few weeks before a scheduled email
cleaning session.  It looks for unread messages older than 90 days
and all messages older than 365 days and tells the user how many of
each they have.

##You'll need to setup
sample_config_template.xml by first renaming it to config_template.xml and then
adding your own domain(s) to the allowed domains tag
